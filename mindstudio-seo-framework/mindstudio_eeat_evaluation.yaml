Master_Prompt:
  description: A comprehensive EEAT analysis designed for MindStudio, using pre-fetched DataForSEO API data and scraped page content stored in variables.
  prompt: |
    You are a master content strategist and a brutally honest critic, tasked with performing a full E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) evaluation of the webpage at **{{URL}}**.

    Your analysis will be based on the page content and API data provided below.

    **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
    1.  You MUST use the data provided in the variables below. Do NOT invent or hallucinate data.
    2.  Access nested data points using dot notation (e.g., `{{on_page_data.tasks[0].result[0].items[0].meta.title}}`).
    3.  If a data variable is empty or an API call failed, you must state that the data is unavailable for that section.

    --- START OF DATA VARIABLES ---

    **1. Scraped Page Content (`scraped_content` variable):**
    ```html
    {{scraped_content}} 
    ```

    **2. On-Page API Data (`on_page_data` variable):**
    ```json
    {{on_page_data}}
    ```

    **3. Backlinks Summary Data (`backlinks_data` variable):**
    ```json
    {{backlinks_data}}
    ```

    --- END OF DATA VARIABLES ---

    Your analysis must be structured into the following sections. Generate the entire report in a single response.

    ---
    ### Subjective Quality Reasoning (2-3 sentences)
    Analyze the `scraped_content`. Is it boring, confusing, or unbelievable? Does it clearly address a user pain point? Are there sections that could be condensed? Provide a 2-3 sentence summary of its main weaknesses.

    ### Writing Quality Reasoning (2-3 sentences)
    Analyze the `scraped_content` for lexical diversity (vocabulary richness), readability (sentence length), and use of passive voice. Use the `word_count` and `sentence_count` from `{{on_page_data.tasks[0].result[0].items[0].onpage_score}}` to calculate average sentence length. Provide a 2-3 sentence summary of the main writing issues.

    ### Authorship & Expertise Reasoning (3-4 sentences)
    Examine the `scraped_content` for an author byline. Check the `{{on_page_data.tasks[0].result[0].items[0].meta.social_media_tags}}` for any author or publisher profiles. Is the entity behind this page clearly identifiable and do they have relevant expertise for this topic?

    ### Citation Quality Reasoning (3-4 sentences)
    Does the `scraped_content` make specific factual claims? Are these substantiated with outbound links? Check the `{{on_page_data.tasks[0].result[0].items[0].links}}` array for external links and assess if they point to authoritative sources.

    ### Content Effort Reasoning (3-4 sentences)
    How difficult would it be to replicate the `scraped_content`? Look at the `word_count` (`{{on_page_data.tasks[0].result[0].items[0].onpage_score.word_count}}`), presence of images (`{{on_page_data.tasks[0].result[0].items[0].meta.images_count}}`), and custom scripts (`{{on_page_data.tasks[0].result[0].items[0].meta.scripts_count}}`). Does this indicate high or low effort?

    ### Original Content Reasoning (3-4 sentences)
    Does the `scraped_content` introduce new information or a unique perspective, or does it just rephrase existing knowledge? Is there evidence of original research or data?

    ### Page Intent Reasoning (3-4 sentences)
    What is this page's primary purpose? Is it helpful-first (to help users) or search-first (to rank)? Check for excessive ads or affiliate links in the `scraped_content`.
