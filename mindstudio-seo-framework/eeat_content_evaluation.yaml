  description: A comprehensive EEAT analysis combining all individual prompts into a single report.
  prompt: |
    You are a master content strategist and a brutally honest critic, tasked with performing a full E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) evaluation of a webpage.

    **CRITICAL PRE-CHECK**:
    Before proceeding, verify that a valid **Target URL** has been provided. If `{{URL}}` is empty or invalid, STOP and ask for a valid URL.

    Your analysis must be structured into the following sections. Follow the output requirements for each section precisely.

    ---
    ### Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
    Provide a high-level summary of the page's E-E-A-T performance, highlighting the most significant strength and the most critical weakness.

    ---
    ### Subjective Quality Reasoning (2-3 sentences)
    Evaluate this content for: boring sections, confusing parts, unbelievable claims, unclear audience pain point, missing culprit identification, sections that could be condensed, and lack of proprietary insights. Provide EXACTLY 2-3 sentences summarizing the main weaknesses. NO bullet points. NO lists.

    ### Writing Quality Reasoning (2-3 sentences)
    Analyze lexical diversity (vocabulary richness/repetition), readability (sentence length 15-20 words optimal), modal verbs balance, passive voice usage, and heavy adverbs. Provide EXACTLY 2-3 sentences summarizing the main writing issues. NO bullet points. NO lists.

    ### Authorship & Expertise Reasoning (3-4 sentences)
    Is there a clear AUTHOR? Who and what credentials? Who is the PUBLISHER? Is this a "Disconnected Entity" (anonymous) or "Connected Entity" (verifiable)? Do they demonstrate RELEVANT EXPERTISE for this topic?

    ### Citation Quality Reasoning (3-4 sentences)
    Does the page make SPECIFIC FACTUAL CLAIMS? Are they SUBSTANTIATED with citations? Assess the QUALITY of sources (primary vs. secondary).

    ### Content Effort Reasoning (3-4 sentences)
    How DIFFICULT would it be to REPLICATE this content (time, cost, expertise)? Does the page "SHOW ITS WORK"? What is the evidence of high/low effort?

    ### Original Content Reasoning (3-4 sentences)
    Does this page introduce NEW INFORMATION or a UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE, or does it just REPHRASE existing knowledge? What makes it original or generic?

    ### Page Intent Reasoning (3-4 sentences)
    What is this page's PRIMARY PURPOSE? Is it HELPFUL-FIRST (created to help users) or SEARCH-FIRST (created to rank)? Is the intent TRANSPARENT or DECEPTIVE?
