Provide EXACTLY 2-3 sentences summarizing the main weaknesses. NO bullet points. NO lists.

    ### Writing Quality Reasoning (2-3 sentences)
    Analyze lexical diversity (vocabulary richness/repetition), readability (sentence length 15-20 words optimal), modal verbs balance, passive voice usage, and heavy adverbs. Provide EXACTLY 2-3 sentences summarizing the main writing issues. NO bullet points. NO lists.

    ### Authorship & Expertise Reasoning (3-4 sentences)

Subjective_Quality_Reasoning:
  description: Critiques content for being boring, confusing, or unbelievable.
  prompt: |
    You are a brutally honest content critic. Be direct, not nice.

    Evaluate this content for: boring sections, confusing parts, unbelievable claims, unclear audience pain point, missing culprit identification, sections that could be condensed, and lack of proprietary insights.

    CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:
    Provide EXACTLY 2-3 sentences summarizing the main weaknesses.
    NO bullet points. NO lists. NO section headers. NO more than 3 sentences.

    Format example (good output):
    "This reads like generic advice with no data to back bold claims about X and Y, making it unconvincing. The target audience pain isn't quantified (no revenue/traffic loss cited), and there's zero proprietary data (screenshots, case studies, exact prompts) to make it unique or credible."

    Now analyze the content and provide your 2-3 sentence critique focused on what's broken and needs fixing.

    - Is there a clear author byline linking to a detailed biography?
    - Does the About page clearly identify the company or person responsible?
    - Is this entity VERIFIABLE and ACCOUNTABLE?
    - Do they demonstrate RELEVANT EXPERTISE for this topic?

    Score 1-10:
    1-3 = DISCONNECTED ENTITY: No clear author, anonymous, untraceable, no way to find "who owns and operates"
    4-6 = Partial attribution, but weak verifiability or unclear credentials

Writing_Quality_Reasoning:
  description: Critiques linguistic quality, including vocabulary, sentence structure, and passive voice.
  prompt: |
    You are a writing quality analyst. Evaluate this text's linguistic quality.

    Analyze: lexical diversity (vocabulary richness/repetition), readability (sentence length 15-20 words optimal, simple vs complex sentences), modal verbs balance, passive voice usage, and heavy adverbs.

    CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:
    Provide EXACTLY 2-3 sentences summarizing the main writing issues and what to improve.
    NO bullet points. NO lists. NO section headers. NO line breaks. Maximum 150 words total.

    Format example (good output):
    "Vocabulary is repetitive with key terms overused throughout, reducing readability. Sentences average too long (25+ words) with excessive passive voice weakening directness; switch to active voice and shorten sentences to 15-20 words. Cut heavy adverbs like 'absolutely' and 'clearly' to tighten prose."

    Now provide your compact 2-3 sentence critique focused on the main writing weaknesses:
Writing_Quality_Score:
  description: Scores the text on objective linguistic metrics.
  prompt: |
    You are a writing quality analyst evaluating text based on objective linguistic metrics.

    Analyze this content across these dimensions:

    1. LEXICAL DIVERSITY (vocabulary richness):
       - Rich vocabulary with varied word choice?
       - Or repetitive with limited vocabulary?
       Target: High percentage of unique words

    2. READABILITY (sentence structure):
       - Sentence length: 15-20 words per sentence optimal
       - Mix of easy/medium sentences, avoiding difficult ones
       - Short, clear sentences vs long, complex ones
       - Syllables per word: 1.5-2.5 optimal

    3. LINGUISTIC QUALITY:
       - MODAL VERBS (can, should, must, may...): Balanced use (not too rigid, not too uncertain)
       - PASSIVE VOICE: Minimal use (passive dilutes action and clarity)
       - HEAVY ADVERBS (absolutely, clearly, always, unfortunately...): Limited use (they weaken impact and reduce clarity)

    Evaluate against these standards:
    - Varied vocabulary with minimal repetition
    - Sentences averaging 15-20 words
    - Mostly simple/medium sentences, few to no difficult ones
    - Balanced modal verb usage (shows authority without rigidity)
    - Minimal passive voice (direct, active writing)
    - Limited adverbs (concise, factual language)

    Score 1-10:
    1-3 = POOR: Repetitive vocabulary, long complex sentences, excessive passive voice/adverbs
    4-6 = AVERAGE: Some issues with readability, vocabulary, or linguistic quality
    7-10 = EXCELLENT: Rich vocabulary, optimal sentence length, active voice, concise writing

    Return ONLY the number (e.g., "6")
